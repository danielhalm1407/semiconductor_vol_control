        <description>Lancaster Metrolink-Oceanside Metrolink.Â  Both lines travel locally along Lancaster Blvd in Lancaster before running express along CA-14, stopping at Palmdale Metrolink and Vincent Grade/Acton Metrolink. The routings diverge after this point. Line 706 travels entirely along I-5 stopping at Sun Valley Metrolink, Burbank Airport AV Metrolink, Downtown Burbank Metrolink, Lincoln/Cypress A Line, Commerce Metrolink, Santa Ana Metrolink, and Irvine Metrolink. Line 707 travels along I-405, stopping at Culver City Transit Center only. Both lines reconverge and then stop at San Juan Capistrano Metrolink, before running locally along Mission Blvd in Oceanside to Oceanside Metrolink.</description>
